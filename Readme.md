# Build smart contract

Throughout this learning experience, I established a solid base in Ethereum smart contract creation, deployment, and interaction. 

Engaging in practical tasks and sharing updates on GitHub allowed me to acquire hands-on knowledge and build a relevant portfolio. 

I learned to create ERC20 tokens, manage blockchain-stored hashed messages, and automate interactions with smart contracts via ethers.js. 

Moreover, I delved into zkSync and paymasters for managing transaction fees and token balances.
